# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview
This project uses kickstarter crowdfunding data for analysis. Earlier recommendationdations were made on how goals and launch dates impact successful campaigns after analyzing the kickstarter data. For this project, the crowdfunding data will be analyzed to see how Louise faired against other campaigns. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to analyze the kickstarter campaign data to find trends and relation between attributes that contribute to a successful crowdfunding campaign. For this analysis, the focus will mainly be on how the goal amount and campaign launch date impacts a successful campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges
As stated in the purpose of the project, the analysis of the kickstarter data was mainly focused on the goal amount and the launch date. Below are the details for the analysis by launch date and goals. Detailed analysis can be found in this spreadsheet link. (Kickstarter Analysis)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For analysis by launch date, the launch date had to be convereted from unix timestamp to short date format. A pivot table and chart that shows the number of campaigns by outcome and launch date, filtered for theater subcategory, as seen in the chart below was created. The launch date column was also grouped to months for easier analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For analysis by goal amount, the goal amount was grouped into 12 different rows. A new table(/sheet) that shows us the number of campaigns by outcomes for each of the goal group was then created. The data was also filtered for "plays" subcategory and charted as shown below. 

### Challenges 
As with any analysis, there were a few challenges that were encountered. 
- The data type in the columns were not formatted correctly. 
- Launch date and end date columns have unix timestamp. The Gregorian date had to be calculated and formatted for our analysis.
- The parent category and Subcategory field were combined in a single column. They had to be split for easier analysis

## Results
### Conclusions based on Launch Date
- Most campaigns were launched in the May - June time frame. Most of the campaigns that are launched in the May - June time frame succeeded (approximately 66%)
- December is the month with the least amount of campaigns. A campaign launched in December had ~49% chance of succeeding. 

### Conclusions based on Goals
- Based on the goals, we can clearly see that most plays were launched with goal amount of less than 10000 (85%). 
- Campaigns with less goal amount succeed more compared to the campaigns with higher goals. Campaigns with goal amount less than 5000 has a 73% - 75% of succeeding.

### Limitations of this dataset
- The dataset has campaign data only up to 2017. 
- There also seems to be only ~4000 campaigns listed for 9 years, all over the world. This seems like we donâ€™t have the complete data for our analysis.

### Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create.
Based on the data available, we could do more analysis that can help launch successful campaign. Some of the analysis are listed below. 
- We can calculate the duration a campaign was open and do analysis on how long it took for campaigns to reach its goal.
- Number of campaigns based on outcomes and categories helps us identify, which category has the most success in kickstarter campaigns.
- We can look at year over year trends for campaign outcomes to see if the demand for a category campaign is still up.
